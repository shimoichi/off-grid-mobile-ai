# Build, install and launch the app on a physical iOS device.
#
# We default to AUTOMATIC signing with -allowProvisioningUpdates so Xcode
# registers whatever device is currently connected and mints a profile that
# carries the app's required entitlements (Extended Virtual Addressing +
# Increased Memory Limit — the large-model app needs these). The old hard-coded
# manual profile ("Off Grid iPhone 12") is device-specific and lacks those
# entitlements, so it fails on any other device; keep it only as an explicit
# fallback via IOS_PROFILE for offline/endpoint-timeout situations.
#
# We bypass `react-native run-ios --device` because it runs xcodebuild without
# these signing overrides.
#
# Override per-machine with env vars if your device/profile/team differ:
#   IOS_DEVICE_ID  — target a specific device UDID
#   IOS_TEAM       — development team id
#   IOS_PROFILE    — set to force MANUAL signing with a named profile (fallback)
set -euo pipefail

# Auto-detect the currently-connected physical iOS device (first reachable one).
# Override with IOS_DEVICE_ID to target a specific device. We ask `devicectl`
# (not `xctrace`) because a wired device that is paired-but-not-tethered-for-
# Instruments shows up under xctrace's "Devices Offline" section even though
# `devicectl`/`xcodebuild -destination id=` can still reach it. We select the
# hardware UDID of the first device whose transport is not "None" (i.e. actually
# connected, wired or over the local network). This never exits non-zero when no
# device is found, so the friendly guard below can report it instead of `set -e`
# aborting the script mid-detection.
