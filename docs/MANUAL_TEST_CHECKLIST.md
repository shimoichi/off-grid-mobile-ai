# Off Grid Mobile — Manual Release Test Checklist

A human-walkable, release-gate checklist. Go through this before every release. Independent of any automated
test claims. Aggregated from **both** adversarial/device sessions:
- Prior 6-agent adversarial sweep (`DEVICE_TEST_LOG.md`): Q1–Q20, M1–M11, D1–D4, V1–V5, log-B1–B9.
- Today's on-device wire-capture run (`DEVICE_TEST_FINDINGS.md`): DEV-B1–B33 + validated successes.

**Columns per row:** `ID · 🔴/✅ Sev · Auto · Steps · UI validation · Ref · Device · Result`
- **🔴/✅ Sev:** 🔴 = adversarial (a known/suspected bug — must be FIXED & verified before release) · ✅ = happy
  (must keep WORKING — regression check). Sev = P0 (blocker/crash/privacy) · P1 (major flow) · P2 (UX/cosmetic).
- **Auto:** automated-test coverage — ✅ (test file named) · ❌ none · ~ partial/service-level · n/a.
- **Steps:** the real gestures to imitate (same for a manual tester and the automated UI test).
- **UI validation:** what to assert on the live rendered screen (+ the RED reason for adversarial rows).
- **Ref · Device:** original bug ID · what today's device run observed (BROKEN/WORKS/NOT-RUN/GUARDED/verify).
- **Result:** you fill ✅/❌ + notes each release.

Coverage (verified against the actual test `it()` titles, not names): **121 cases · 73 automated (✅) ·
7 partial/service-level (~) · 30 not yet automated (❌, incl. 2 deferred) · 11 n/a (product-decision /
code-review / infra).** The 2026-07-12 partial-upgrade pass converted 6 of the 13 partials to full mounted-UI
(T044 parallel tools, T038 thinking+tool+answer, T048 remote parallel tool_calls, T035 thinking-header Q6 red,
T046 remote-server connect) + fixed T071 (enhancementNoThinking, boundary-validated). The 7 still ~ are
legitimately partial (documented, can't be full-UI): T009 (needs RAG UI harness), T050 (folded into T049),
T060 (device-only native crash, no gate exists), T099 (dead-in-prod invariant), T102 (NEEDS-DEVICE jetsam),
T108 (dead branch tied to T004), T110 (latent — 2nd TTS).
The 2026-07-12 residency pass added T111–T120 (Area 3 additions): residency/co-residency/auto-eviction/budget
across modalities × text/voice, validated through the model selector **In Memory** UI. Automated: T111–T117 +
T120 (8). Deferred with honest reasons in `docs/RESIDENCY_TEST_MISMATCHES.md`: **T119** (whisper
blocked→free→retry — needs a download-whisper-without-loading harness helper + budget knob) and **T118**
(embedding sidecar — needs a RAG doc-attach/query UI harness). Both are test-infra gaps, NOT device mismatches.
UI-integration reds written this pass (all `__tests__/integration/`, red-for-the-right-reason, device-grounded):
T001 (`downloadCountDivergence`), T022 (`whisperResidentOnDownload`), T023 (`ejectAllLeavesWhisper`),
T075+T080 (`chatModeSttArchitecture` — chat-mode STT never transcribes; full ChatScreen + real mic gesture).
Areas 1–14 = user-facing flows (T001–T098); **Area 15 (T099–T110)** = the latent/architecture/infra findings
from the 2026-07-12 cross-check that had no row (so this doc is the ONE exhaustive record).
Paste any table into Sheets/Excel (pipe-delimited).

## Automation surface plan — what src each new UI test touches (verified against code, 2026-07-12)

Every un-automated row is being turned into a **UI-behavioral integration test** (mount the real screen, arrive
at the precondition via real gestures, run the whole real stack over fakes at the **device boundary only**,
assert the **terminal artifact the user perceives**). No `store.setState` on the state under test. The honest
accounting of which rows need a src touch (grounded in the code, not guessed):

- **✅ No src change (~75 rows).** Assert on surfaces that already render: reply text, tool-result bubbles,
  generated image + **`GenerationMeta` backend/layers/tok/s** (renders `GPU (24L)` / `CPU` when *Show
  Generation Details* is on → covers the text-backend cluster **T014/T015/T021**), `ModelFailureCard` "Not
  Enough Memory" (**T024/T027/T028**), download cards (**T004–T008**), error bubbles, transcript-in-input,
  thinking block (**T033/T035**), project lists, "No servers found", the **`isRemote` header indicator**
  (**T098**, `ChatScreenComponents.tsx:109`), `stop-button` (**T077/T088**, `ChatInput/index.tsx:312`),
  lightbox, etc.
- **🔧 `testID` added — existing surface, just a selector (~5 rows).**
  **T001** (downloads badge count + DownloadManager running/queued counts), **T003** (model ready/preparing
  status label), **T057** (pre-send attach thumbnail tap target), **T086** (thinking-bubble + voice-note-bubble
  to compare widths).
- **🏷️ Test-mode-only label behind a jest-only flag (never dev/prod) (~5 rows).** The **resident set**
  (`getResidents()`) has no clean UI surface — the Models Manager sheet shows per-*type* rows
  (`models-row-${type}`), not "is whisper resident". So **T022/T023/T025/T026/T030** get one small
  `probe-residents` label gated by a new `__TEST_PROBE__` flag (set only in jest setup). **T016/T072** (8s GPU
  timeout, enhancement-slow) — timing isn't rendered; assert the *outcome* on existing surfaces and drop the
  raw-timing sub-assertion (no label) unless a `probe-timing` is later wanted.
- **🎧 Audio-boundary — assert at the boundary stub, not the UI (documented §D audio exception) (~3 rows).**
  **T081/T082** (TTS speaks / markdown-stripped): audio isn't a rendered surface; assert what reached the
  `speak` seam (already how `speakMessage`/`speakMarkdown` work). No src change.

Bottom line: the only planned src touches are **~5 `testID`s** + **one `probe-residents` test-mode label**
(+ its `__TEST_PROBE__` jest-only gate). Everything else rides existing rendered output or the audio boundary.

## Area 1 — Model download & management

Columns: **Auto** = automated test (✅ file · ❌ none · ~ partial). **Steps** = gestures to imitate (same for a
manual tester and the automated test). **UI validation** = what to assert on the live rendered screen.

| ID | 🔴/✅ Sev | Auto | Steps (gestures to imitate) | UI validation (assert on live screen) | Ref · Device | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T001 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `downloadCountDivergence.rendered.redflow` | Mount ModelsScreen → tap download on a **vision** model (mmproj → 2 rows, per log: `SmolVLM-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` + `…-mmproj.gguf`) → read `downloads-icon` badge (`vm.activeDownloadCount`) → tap `downloads-icon` → DownloadManagerScreen | `downloads-icon` badge number **==** DownloadManagerScreen running (`activeDownloadingCount`) + queued (`activeQueuedCount`) (RED: device saw badge **10** vs screen **4+7=11** — off by 1 while mmproj in-flight). Falsify: non-vision model (no mmproj) → equal | DEV-B7 · BROKEN | |
| T002 | 🔴 P2 | n/a (product decision) | Drive `DownloadComplete` for a text model, then an image model, in the same foreground state | completion notification behavior is consistent + intentional. NOTE: my earlier "image notifies, text doesn't" was CORRECTED — device showed **text models DID notify** (SmolLM3, Mistral); real variable is foreground/timing. User's gripe: the toast is noisy ("shouldn't have come"). *Product decision: show a completion toast at all?* **Reds-pass: SKIPPED — no falsifiable bug (behavior is type-independent/consistent); "should the toast exist" is a product question, not a spec violation.** | DEV-B4 · corrected (type-independent) | |
| T003 | 🔴 P1 | n/a (not reproducible) | Start image-model download → fake emits native `DownloadComplete` but zip NOT extracted (no `_ready`, integrity files absent on memfs) → select model + image-mode send | model status ≠ "ready/usable" until extracted; on generate a visible "preparing/extracting" state (RED: "downloaded successfully" fires at native-complete, extract deferred) **Reds-pass: SKIPPED — code gates readiness on extraction: `imageDownloadActions.ts:446-453` does unzip → `ensureImageExtractionComplete` (integrity) → `_ready` → THEN `registerAndNotify`. The device's premature "downloaded successfully" was the native NOTIFICATION (T002), not app readiness. Mid-unzip-kill recovery is covered by T004.** | DEV-B4 · PREMATURE→corrected | |
| T004 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `imageExtractLostRelaunch` | Seed image download that completes-then-extraction-fails (missing `unet.bin`) → `simulateRelaunch()` (fresh stores, drop native rows, keep disk) → mount DownloadManagerScreen | a retriable/removable **failed card** renders after relaunch (RED: none renders — store not persisted, dir/zip unlinked) | D1/log-B7 · BROKEN | |
| T005 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `whisperDeleteCancelsOther` | Start `base.en` whisper download (fake, in-flight) → mount DownloadManagerScreen → tap delete on downloaded `small.en` → confirm alert | `base.en`'s in-progress card **still present** after deleting small.en (RED: it vanishes — deleteModel cancels the single activeDownloadId) | V1 · BROKEN | |
| T006 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `whisperTruncatedListed` | Seed a truncated `ggml-<id>.bin` on disk (below size floor) → mount DownloadManagerScreen / model list | truncated file NOT listed as a completed/loadable model (RED: shown as downloaded — name-only filter, no size floor) | V2 · BROKEN | |
| T007 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `sttInterruptedRelaunch` | Seed STT download killed mid-flight → `simulateRelaunch()` → mount DownloadManagerScreen | a retriable/removable entry renders (RED: empty — store not persisted, no disk scan) | V3/D1 · BROKEN | |
| T008 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `iosInterruptedNoFailedEntry` | iOS-shaped: download running → drop the native URLSession row (app-kill) → `simulateRelaunch()` → mount DownloadManagerScreen | a stranded/failed entry renders (RED: vanishes — reconcile reads empty native-rebuilt store) | D4 · NOT-RUN device | |
| T009 | ✅ P1 | ~ `searchKnowledgeBaseRoundtrip`/`indexDocumentRollback` | Mount → create project (form) → attach a text PDF to its KB (attach gesture); PDF fake returns real text; embed fake 384-dim | KB shows the doc indexed (chunk/embedding count); no error card | DEV · WORKS | |
| T010 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `kbScannedPdfMessage.rendered.redflow` | Attach a **scanned/image** PDF (native PDFExtractorModule returns '') to a KB → tap Add Document | a clear "scanned PDF / no text layer" message renders (RED: the alert is the vague "Could not extract text from document"). Real KnowledgeBaseScreen + real ragService/documentService/pdfExtractor over memfs + picker + native-PDF + Alert boundaries. Falsified: a clear scanned-PDF message → green (verified). FIX-mode: name the scanned/no-text-layer cause | DEV · 0-text vague | |
| T011 | ✅ P2 | ✅ `kbFileSizeGuard.rendered.happy` | Attach a **>5MB** file to a KB (memfs file >5MB) → tap Add Document | "Maximum size is 5MB" alert + no document added (KB list stays "No documents yet"). GREEN guard: real KnowledgeBaseScreen + real ragService/documentService over memfs + picker + Alert boundaries. Falsified: a <5MB file does NOT trigger the 5MB rejection | DEV · GATED | |
| T012 | ✅ P2 | ✅ `downloadedCountBadge.rendered.happy` | Seed N downloaded models (boundary) → mount ModelsScreen | exactly N cards render the DOWNLOADED indicator (`model-card-{i}-downloaded`). NOTE: ModelsScreen has no aggregate count badge (the header badge is in-flight = T001; the per-type numeral is Home = T097) — the per-card downloaded mark is the real ModelsScreen surface. N emergent from the seeded fs+record boundary via real hydration. Falsified: flip N; remove the indicator testID → 0 marks | DEV · WORKS | |

## Area 2 — Model load & compute backends

| ID | 🔴/✅ Sev | Auto | Steps (gestures to imitate) | UI validation (assert on live screen) | Ref · Device | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T013 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `firstMessage`/`modelLifecycle` | Model downloaded (boundary) → mount Home → tap `browse-models-button` → tap `model-item` (select) → tap `new-chat-button` → type + send | reply text renders in an assistant bubble (lazy-load on first send works) | DEV · WORKS | |
| T014 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `gpuBackendMeta.rendered.happy` | Mount → Model Settings → Text → Advanced → tap Backend → **GPU/OpenCL** → reload → send; llama-load fake reports OpenCL offload | reply renders; GenerationMeta shows "OpenCL (24L)" — GPU layers offloaded, not CPU. Real BackendSelector gesture → real reload banner → real captureGpuInfo (fake initLlama echoes gpu/devices from n_gpu_layers, EMERGENT). Falsified: CPU backend → "CPU", no "(NL)"; breaking `gpuEnabled` in llmHelpers flips it red | DEV · WORKS (24/36) | |
| T015 | 🔴 P1 | ❌ DEFERRED (native-only) | Same, Backend = **NPU (Beta)/HTP** → reload → send; HTP loads then emits gibberish | assistant reply is a **correct answer**, not gibberish/empty. **DEFERRED — native-only, no JS surface: no app-side gate detects gibberish or blocks NPU for gemma-style models, so a "coherent reply" test would only assert the fake's tokens (testing-the-fake). See `RESIDENCY_TEST_MISMATCHES.md`. The backend/layers load surfacing is covered by T014; the gibberish is a Hexagon-firmware issue (human/device check).** | DEV-B22 · BROKEN | |
| T016 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `gpuInitTimeoutFallback.rendered.happy` | Pick GPU/OpenCL → reload; the GPU init times out | the model still loads on CPU and a reply renders (graceful fallback, no silent hang); GenerationMeta shows CPU, not a phantom GPU offload. Real initContextWithFallback (attempt 1 GPU rejects via the `scriptGpuInitFailure` fake knob → attempt 2 CPU succeeds). Falsify: without the failure, OpenCL keeps the offload (meta "OpenCL (NL)"). The raw 8s timing has no surface (dropped, per plan) | DEV-B24 · timeout→24/36 | |
| T017 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `firstMessage` (litert) | litert model downloaded → select via Home picker → new chat → send | reply renders (litert GPU works) | DEV · WORKS | |
| T018 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `litertCpuInvokeError.rendered.redflow` | Select litert model → Advanced → Backend = **CPU** → reload → send; litert fake emits `Status 13 Failed to invoke the compiled model` | an answer renders, OR the CPU option isn't offered for a GPU-compiled model (RED: error alert shows, NO answer bubble). Native step (manual): CPU actually throws Status 13 for a .litertlm | DEV-B23 · BROKEN | |
| T019 | 🔴 P2 | ❌ DEFERRED (native-only) | litert + tools + a long tool prompt; native clamps ctx to 880 | a tool-result bubble renders. **DEFERRED — native-only: the clamp (4096→880) IS JS-observable but the clamp→tool-drop conversion happens inside the native LiteRT runtime; grep confirms NO JS seam gates/drops tools on context size, so a test would be fake-on-fake. See `RESIDENCY_TEST_MISMATCHES.md`. Candidate FIX-mode guard: surface "tools don't fit clamped context" (then a real UI red rides it)** | DEV-B25 · dropped once | |
| T020 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `litertLazyOnSelect.rendered.happy` | Select a litert model in the picker (no send) → open the model selector; then send | **SUPERSEDED premise:** eager-warm-on-select was intentionally removed (`useModelLoading.ts:27-31` — it raced the load path + left two heavies co-resident). Current spec = lazy: In Memory shows NO `resident-item-text` after select, and DOES after the first send (matches T013 "lazy loading I wanted"). Falsified: forcing the pre-load (eager) makes `resident-item-text` present before send → red | DEV · WORKS (now lazy by design) | |
| T021 | 🔴 P2 | ❌ DEFERRED (needs a PRODUCT decision) | Load a vision gguf (gemma-4-E2B + mmproj) via select+send | estimate not mmproj-inflated. **DEFERRED — blocked on a product call, not a knob: (1) GenerationMeta GPU/CPU is the WRONG surface (Android nGpuLayers ignores the estimate → would duplicate T014); (2) B3's harm (`(main+mmproj)*1.5` = 5854MB) is the multiplier MAGNITUDE — whether a vision gguf whose main weights fit "should" load, CPU-fallback, or refuse is a product decision. Once decided, the mmproj-seed harness knob + a false-refusal-card assertion are straightforward. Narrow variant of the T024/T027/T028 estimator family. See `RESIDENCY_TEST_MISMATCHES.md`** | DEV-B3 · CPU-fallback | |

## Area 3 — Memory / residency / budget

| ID | 🔴/✅ Sev | Auto | Steps (gestures to imitate) | UI validation (assert on live screen) | Ref · Device | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T022 | 🔴 P0 | ✅ `whisperResidentOnDownload.rendered.redflow` | Download an STT model (download fake `complete` event) → do NOT transcribe → load a chat model via picker+send | whisper NOT auto-resident; chat model loads without a phantom 1.5GB resident (invariant: assert `getResidents()` excludes whisper) (RED: whisper auto-loads on download) | DEV-B1 · BROKEN | |
| T023 | 🔴 P0 | ✅ `ejectAllLeavesWhisper.rendered.redflow` | Whisper resident (via the real download gesture) → trigger Eject All (`activeModelService.ejectAll`, the Home button's onPress; button guard needs a co-active text/image model) | after eject, `getResidents()` == [] incl. whisper (RED: ejectAll returns count=1, whisper survives) | DEV-B1 · BROKEN | |
| T023b | 🔴 P0 | ✅ `ejectAllUnloadsEveryType.rendered.redflow` | Register text+image+whisper+tts+embedding resident → REAL `ejectAll` | getResidents() is EMPTY after eject (RED: whisper+tts+embedding remain — ejectAll only unloads text+image, index.ts:437; budget stays inflated). General form of T023 | DEV-B1 · BROKEN | |
| T024 | 🔴 P0 | ✅ `budgetRedflow`(M2/M3 arithmetic) + `imageOomCard.happy` (card render) | Seed RAM so soft budget≥size but `os_procAvail`<size → drive the load; assert refusal | load refused (graceful "Not Enough Memory" card) / no over-commit (invariant: `fits` gates on PHYSICAL, not soft budget) (RED: fits=true while size>procAvail). **Coverage split (honest): the over-commit ARITHMETIC is a gesture-less invariant → `budgetRedflow` M2/M3 (service-level, red); the CARD render is UI-behavioral → `imageOomCard.happy` (mounts ChatScreen, drops RAM, asserts the card + Load-Anyway). A UI over-commit red isn't added because the chat harness has no per-model-size knob to reproduce the exact reclaim-credit arithmetic — the bug's natural altitude is the service.** | DEV-B2/M2/M3 · BROKEN | |
| T025 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `residencySwap`/`resendAfterImageGen` | Generate an image (image resident) → go to chat → send text | (invariant) text load evicts image (`evicted` contains 'image'); text-model reply renders | M11/DEV · WORKS | |
| T026 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `budgetRedflow`(M1) | Load text model → start image-gen | text & image do NOT co-reside (`getResidents()` has one heavy) (verify — worked in one device flow) | M1/M16 · verify | |
| T027 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `imageEstimatorDivergence` | Image model: the pre-load advisory (`checkMemoryForModel` 1.5/1.8×) vs the gate (`estimateImageModelRam` 2.5×) | both estimators agree (invariant) (RED: ~40% divergence → "safe to load" then a hard "not enough memory" card) | Q14 · BROKEN | |
| T028 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `overrideFloor` | Load-Anyway a too-big dirty model at low real free RAM (RAM fake) | survival floor BLOCKS the guaranteed OOM (invariant: post-load free ≥ floor uses REAL free, not credited ceiling) | M3/M4 · verify | |
| T029 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `overrideFloor`(M5) | iOS 12GB, 3.1GB free → Load-Anyway a 2GB dirty litert model (RAM fake, platform ios) | NOT over-refused (loads) (RED: flat 1200 floor over-refuses a safe load) | M5 · NOT-RUN device | |
| T030 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `ttsDeleteResidencyStale` | Load TTS (registers key:'tts') → delete TTS in DM (gesture) → load a text/image model | no phantom TTS pressure (invariant: `release('tts')` fired on delete → resident set excludes tts) (RED: 320MB phantom → wrong refusal) | V4 · BROKEN | |
| T031 | ℹ️ P0 | n/a (device-stress observation) | Drive a very long/runaway context, keep sending | thermal-throttle → 30–47s/token → crash under heavy/polluted context. **IGNORED per user: a device-stress data point (user was intentionally pushing past limits), not a fixable/testable app bug — no app-side guard to assert.** | DEV-B31 · observation | |

### Area 3 additions (2026-07-12) — residency / co-residency / auto-eviction / budget across modalities & text/voice

Prior Area 3 rows are text/image + eject-centric. These add the missing modality × scenario cells, and — per the
new pattern — **validate residency through the model selector's real "In Memory" section** (`in-memory-section`,
`resident-item-${type}`, `resident-${type}-ram`, `eject-resident-${type}`), the feature that removed the residency
black box, instead of reading `getResidents()`. Trace any failure with `DEBUG_LOGS=1 npx jest <file>` (mirrors all
`[MODEL-SM]`/`[MEM-SM]`/`[COMPOSER-SM]` source logs to stderr).

| ID | 🔴/✅ Sev | Auto | Steps (gestures to imitate) | UI validation (assert on live screen) | Ref · Device | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T111 | ✅ P0 | ✅ `sttReclaimedOnSend.rendered.happy` | Text model + whisper both resident (roomy device) → drop device to ≤6GB (RAM fake) → type + send a text turn | the reply renders AND the model selector **In Memory** section no longer lists whisper (`resident-item-whisper` gone) while `resident-item-text` stays — idle STT reclaimed for the generation working set. Falsify: keep device >6GB → whisper stays listed | DEV-B1/B2 · GUARDED | |
| T112 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `modelSelectorEjectResident.rendered.redflow` | Reach image + whisper resident (real load + real STT select) → open the model selector | **In Memory** lists every resident with its RAM (`resident-${type}-ram` shows `GB RAM`); tap `eject-resident-whisper` → frees ONLY whisper (its real unload runs), image stays (`resident-item-image` remains) | DEV-B1 · GUARDED | |
| T113 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `modelSelectorShowsLoadedRam.rendered.redflow` | Load a text (and image) model → open the model selector | the selector shows the loaded model name + its RAM consumed (`currently-loaded-model-ram`) — removes the black box | DEV · GUARDED | |
| T114 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `lazyReloadAfterEject.rendered.redflow` | Text model resident → eject it via the In Memory section → send a new message | the ejected model lazy-reloads on demand and the answer renders (eject frees RAM, does not disable the model) | DEV-B1 · GUARDED | |
| T115 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `voiceNoteReclaimsStt.rendered.happy` | **Voice**: whisper + text resident on a ≤6GB device → record a voice note → send (real transcribe → onTranscript → send) | after transcription the idle whisper is reclaimed for the LLM turn — In Memory drops `resident-item-whisper`, keeps text; the reply is an AUDIO bubble (`audio-bubble-<id>`, spoken via TTS). Voice-modality twin of T111 (reclaim fires on the same send path — confirmed via `[ModelResidency] reclaiming idle STT` trace). Falsified: roomy → whisper stays → red | DEV-B1/B2 · GUARDED | |
| T116 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `textWhisperCoresident.rendered.happy` | **Allowed co-residence**: roomy device (>6GB) → text model resident → download+select whisper (STT) | In Memory lists BOTH `resident-item-text` and `resident-item-whisper` — the single-HEAVY rule evicts heavies for each other, NOT the STT sidecar (which co-resides warm). Contrast to T026 (two heavies must NOT co-reside). Falsified: skip the whisper load → not listed → red | M1/M16 · GUARDED | |
| T117 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `memoryWarningEvictsSidecars.rendered.happy` | **Auto-eviction**: text + whisper (+tts) resident → fire an OS memory-warning (native boundary event) → open the selector | idle sidecars (whisper/tts/embedding) are reclaimed by `handleMemoryWarning`; In Memory drops them, the active heavy stays. Fired via the boundary's capturing AppState (`emitMemoryWarning`) → the app's REAL listener. Falsified: no warning → whisper stays → red | DEV · GUARDED | |
| T118 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `embeddingSidecarResident.rendered.happy` | **Embedding sidecar**: project + KB → attach a doc (real KB gesture) → the first real embed() runs | the embedding model lazy-loads and co-resides as a sidecar — the model selector In Memory section lists `resident-item-embedding`. Mounts the REAL KnowledgeBaseScreen + real ragService/documentService/embeddingService over memfs + picker + llama-`embedding()` + REAL node:sqlite (installNativeBoundary composed with doMockRealSqlite). Precondition: absent before the embed. Falsified: removing the residency `register` → never appears → red | DEV · GUARDED | |
| T119 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `whisperBlockedFreeRetry.rendered.happy` | **Whisper blocked→free→retry**: tight device (budget pinned 700MB, text resident), whisper downloaded-not-loaded → record a voice note | the first whisper load is `blocked` (`[MEM-SM] makeRoomFor whisper residents=[text:6144] fits=false`), `ensureWhisperForTranscription` frees the text model, retries (`residents=[] fits=true`) → whisper loads, transcript reaches the model, the reply renders as an audio bubble. Real voice path over budget-knob + download-only whisper (boundary). Falsified: neutralizing `freeGenerationModels` → blocked twice → no reply → red | DEV-B1 · GUARDED | |
| T120 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `ttsCoresidentInVoiceTurn.rendered.happy` | **TTS co-residence in a voice turn**: voice mode → complete a turn that speaks the reply (TTS loads as a sidecar) | In Memory lists `resident-item-tts` with its RAM, co-resident with `resident-item-text` (TTS is a reclaimable sidecar, canEvict when playback idle — not a co-resident heavy). Contrast to T030 (stale TTS phantom on delete). Falsified: no voice mode → tts absent → red | V4/V5 · GUARDED | |

## Area 4 — Text generation (thinking / streaming / stop / queue)

| ID | 🔴/✅ Sev | Auto | Steps (gestures to imitate) | UI validation (assert on live screen) | Ref · Device | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T032 | ✅ P1 | ✅ `firstMessage` | Thinking off, tools off → type + send a plain prompt (litert fake streams a clean answer) | reply text renders in the answer bubble; NO stray `<think></think>` block | DEV · WORKS | |
| T033 | 🔴 P1 | ✅ `thinkingRendersInBlockMidStream.rendered.redflow` (GREEN guard, falsified — B14 fixed) | Thinking ON → send a reasoning prompt; llama fake streams `<think>…</think>` (Qwen) tokens | during streaming, reasoning tokens render in the THINKING block (answer bubble stays empty) from token 1 (RED: they render in the answer bubble until the close delimiter, then reclassify) | DEV-B14/B5 · BROKEN | |
| T034 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `maxPredictSilentCutoff.rendered.redflow` | Send a prompt whose completion hits the max-predict cap (boundary emits `stopped_eos=false, stopped_limit=1` at n_predict) | a "cut off / continue" indication renders (RED: llm.ts ignores stopped_eos, no Message field, no cutoff surface → silent truncation). Truncation is EMERGENT via the additive `completionMeta` fake (normal turn = no indicator precondition). FIX-mode: surface stopped_eos → render `message-cutoff-indicator` | DEV-B15 · silent cutoff | |
| T035 | 🔴 P2 | ✅ `thinkingHeaderWhileStreaming.rendered.redflow` | litert/remote turn (separate reasoning channel) — assert the thinking-box header WHILE reasoning streams | header reads "Thinking…" while streaming (RED: shows the DONE label + "T" badge; llama inline `<think>` is correct → divergence) | Q6 · BROKEN | |

These findings from `DEVICE_TEST_FINDINGS.md` + the prior Q/M/D/V sweep (`DEVICE_TEST_LOG.md`) had NO row
until this cross-check. Most are NOT user-gesture tests — they are latent code footguns, SOLID/DRY

the ONE exhaustive record. **Auto:** ✅ test · ~ partial · ❌ none · n/a = code-review/infra (no runtime UI
surface). **Verification (2026-07-12):** 10/12 line-refs re-confirmed against CURRENT code — Q15

the code MECHANISM is confirmed (`memoryBudget.ts` clean/dirty + `aggressive` LoadPolicy) but the exact

| T105 | 🔴 P2 | n/a (code-review + FIX-mode) | Code review — `activeModelService/types.ts:50` `IMAGE_MODEL_OVERHEAD_MULTIPLIER = Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 1.5 : 1.8` | the overhead is capability-as-DATA (CoreML vs ONNX runtime), normalized once, NOT a `Platform.OS` mechanism branch. Consumed by `memory.ts:53`. No runtime UI surface; fix in FIX-mode | M8 · SOLID/Platform.OS | |
| T106 | 🔴 P2 | n/a (code-review + FIX-mode) | Code review — `SIDECAR_TYPES` is defined TWICE: `modelResidency/policy.ts:55` AND `modelResidency/index.ts:34` (+ the physical-cap expression duplicated) | one definition, imported everywhere (single source of truth) — two owners can drift (a sidecar type added to one, missed in the other). No runtime UI surface; fix in FIX-mode by exporting from `policy.ts` and importing in `index.ts` | M9 · DRY | |
| T107 | 🔴 P1 | n/a (jest.config fix) | Inspect `jest.config.js` `testPathIgnorePatterns`; drop a dummy `.test.ts` under `__tests__/integration/memory/ios/` and confirm jest never runs it | anchor the unanchored `'/android/'` + `'/ios/'` patterns to `<rootDir>/` (as `/pro/` already is) so a platform-named test dir isn't silently skipped; also add `.claude/worktrees/` to the ignore list (currently test-collected — stale worktree dupes in `--listTests`). **VERIFIED 2026-07-12: patterns ARE unanchored, but NO current memory test sits under those paths → the memory suite (T024/26/28/29/30) genuinely runs today; the trap is latent, fix pre-emptively** | M10 · infra (confirmed by 2 agents) | |
| T108 | 🔴 P2 | ~ (tied to T004 `imageExtractLostRelaunch`) | Relaunch mid-unzip: partial extracted dir, no `_ready`, `_zip_name` present, the zip still on disk → the `scan.ts:228-262` recovery | on next launch the recovery re-extracts from the surviving zip (RED: the zip-finalize catch deletes dir+zip FIRST, so this branch can NEVER fire for the primary zip path — dead code). Fixed together with T004 (D1) option b (keep the zip on extract-fail) | D2 · dead branch | |
| T109 | 🔴 P1 | n/a (code-review + FIX-mode; ROOT behind D1/D2/T003/T004) | Code review — `imageDownloadActions.ts` + `imageDownloadResume.ts` own unzip, integrity, `_ready`/`_zip_name` writes, cleanup, store mutation, retry | image download FINALIZE belongs in a SERVICE (an image finalizer under `modelDownloadService`), NOT in the screen — the "no side-effects/finalize logic/store-mutation in presentation" rule. Text has a `textProvider` seam; image has none — this is WHY T003/T004/T108 have no correct home. FIX-mode: build the image finalizer, migrate the logic off the screen | D3 · SoC root | |
| T110 | 🔴 P2 | ~ (T083 is "V5-gap · verify") | With TWO TTS engines registered, one ACTIVE → in DM tap delete/retry on the NON-active TTS engine | the op targets the SPECIFIED engine without flipping the active selection (RED: `ttsProvider.remove`/`retry` do `if (engineId !== active) setEngine(engineId)` → active flips to the target, now model-less; and `setEngine` never `release('tts')`, so the stale resident's unload fn releases the WRONG engine). LATENT — only kokoro registered today, fires when a 2nd TTS ships. Fix: operate on the target instance without switching active | V5 · latent | |

## Platform parity (iOS — run the native-divergent ones)
Re-run on iOS (native differs): T003/T004/T008 (downloads/URLSession-kill), T015–T021 (backends — note litert is
Android-only; iOS has Metal), T024/T028/T029 (memory/jetsam), T054–T056 (vision Core ML), T061/T068 (image Core
ML + lightbox), T075–T080 (STT), T081 (TTS). Shared-JS areas (remote framing, thinking parse, routing) are
covered by Android — don't re-run the full matrix on iOS.

### Summary counts (fill Result each release)
- Adversarial 🔴 to verify-fixed: ~63 · Happy ✅ regression: ~25 · Known model-limits ℹ️: 3 · product-decision n/a: 1.
- P0 blockers to watch: T022/T023 (whisper leak+eject), T024/T031 (memory/thermal), T075/T080 (STT capture+arch).
- **Area 15 (T099–T110) — non-user-facing residue:** T099 (Q15 `fits`-ignored OOM footgun), T101 (Q18 litert
  mid-convo sampler), T102 (M4 iOS clean-GGUF working-set), T103 (M6 aggressive over-commit) are testable;
  T104/T105/T106/T109 (M7/M8/M9/D3 SOLID/DRY/SoC) + T107 (M10 jest infra) are code-review/FIX-mode; T100
  (Q16) + T108 (D2) fold into T026/T004. None are user-facing release blockers, but all are now on record.
