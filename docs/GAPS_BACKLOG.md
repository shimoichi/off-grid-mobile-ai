# Gaps backlog

Honest register of gaps, regressions, dead code, and "not fully done" items. Each
entry has a verdict and evidence. The standing gap agent picks these up, closes
them, and marks them resolved with evidence. Gaps are surfaced, never hidden.

Verdict legend:
- **delete-safe** - unreferenced / unreachable and provably unused; remove it.
- **fix-the-guard** - the branch is SUPPOSED to fire but a condition prevents it; fix the condition (this is a latent bug, not litter).
- **instrument-and-revisit** - uncertain trigger; add a `[*-SM]` trace + a Provit journey to observe it live before deciding.

## Dead-code recon - 2026-07-06

Recon sweep (4 parallel agents over disjoint subsystems) for unreferenced exports,
unreachable branches, duplicated logic, and threaded-but-unread params. All findings
grep-verified. Nothing deleted yet - this is the register; deletions land as their own
small PRs after each is confirmed.

### Model-load / generation

| # | Location | Symbol | Verdict | Note |
|---|----------|--------|---------|------|
| ML1 | activeModelService/index.ts:~469 | `getCurrentlyLoadedMemoryGB()` (private wrapper) | instrument-and-revisit | CORRECTION: recon said "zero call sites" but tests DO exercise it (integration + memory unit). Test-only API - deleting needs the tests reworked, not a blind delete. |
| ML2 | activeModelService/index.ts:~475 | `checkMemoryForDualModel()` (public wrapper) | instrument-and-revisit | CORRECTION: exercised by integration tests + mocked in HomeScreen test. Prod never calls it - decide keep-vs-remove in the dead-code PR, with tests. |
| ML3 | activeModelService/utils.ts:16-17 vs types.ts:48-50 | overhead multipliers (1.2/1.3 hardcoded vs 1.5/1.8 constants) | fix-the-guard | HomeScreen memory display disagrees with the load-path math; import the shared constants |
| ML4 | useChatModelActions.ts (needsReload double-check) | redundant `&& loadedPath === activeModel.filePath` | instrument-and-revisit | logically impossible to be false; simplify |
| ML5 | activeModelService/index.ts:~338 + loaders.ts | `cpuOnly: false` (always false) | delete-safe | native CPU-only branch unreachable from TS |

> Note: the recon confirmed the "Load Anyway" flow is NOT dead once the residency gate
> throws a typed `OverridableMemoryError` (shipped in this PR). Before that, the raised
> pre-check budget made `canLoad` almost always true, so the pre-check's Load-Anyway was
> effectively unreachable - the root cause of "Load Anyway stopped happening".

### Download / model-manager

| # | Location | Symbol | Verdict | Note |
|---|----------|--------|---------|------|
| DL1 | downloadHydration.ts:33 | `case 'retrying'` in mapNativeStatus | delete-safe | native (iOS+Android) never emits 'retrying' |
| DL2 | DownloadManagerScreen/items.tsx:51,60,81,91 (+ downloadStatusIcon.ts, downloadErrors.ts, useDownloads.ts) | branches on `status === 'retrying'` | fix-the-guard | unreachable given DL1; remove or document the contract |
| DL3 | modelManager/types.ts:13 | `BackgroundDownloadMetadataCallback` (@deprecated, no-op) | delete-safe | author-confirmed no-op, still threaded through 3 sites |
| DL4 | downloadHydration.ts:25 | `export isMmProjFileName` | delete-safe | only used internally; drop the export |
| DL5 | modelManager/download.ts:454-462 | `isFinalizing` reset only on error | instrument-and-revisit | verify re-entrancy window on success path |

### Audio / TTS / STT

| # | Location | Symbol | Verdict | Note |
|---|----------|--------|---------|------|
| AU1 | whisperStore.ts:172-189 | `deleteModel()` (vs used `deleteModelById`) | delete-safe | zero call sites |
| AU2 | audioSessionManager.ts:51-57 | `ensurePlayback()` | delete-safe | only referenced in comments |
| AU3 | whisperService.ts:145-164 (+ store 97-116) | `downloadFromUrl()` | delete-safe | only reached from an unused store action |
| AU4 | ChatInput/Voice.ts:136-143 | stopRecording early-return guard | fix-the-guard | inverted condition; can't be true when recording |
| AU5 | whisperService.ts:338-400 | `transcriptionFullyStopped` promise overwrite | fix-the-guard | new start replaces a promise unloadModel may await |
| AU6 | audioRecorderService.ts:12-14 | `supportsDirectAudioInput()` stub `return true` | instrument-and-revisit | placeholder; add real capability detection |

### Image-gen / tools / remote

| # | Location | Symbol | Verdict | Note |
|---|----------|--------|---------|------|
| IM1 | types/index.ts:314-320 | duplicate `ImageGenerationState` | delete-safe | authoritative def is in imageGenerationService.ts |
| IM2 | localDreamGenerator.ts:67 (+ loaders.ts:296) | `backend` param always `'auto'` | delete-safe | 'mnn'/'qnn' branches never reached from TS |
| IM3 | imageGenerationHelpers.ts:42-44 | iOS short-circuit ignores `backend` | fix-the-guard | 'coreml'/default 'mnn' unreachable on iOS; make explicit |
| IM4 | localDreamGenerator.ts:236-238 | `hasKernelCache()` wraps `hasOpenCLCache` (name mismatch) | fix-the-guard | rename to match native call |
| IM5 | localDreamGenerator.ts:231-239 | `clearOpenCLCache`/`hasKernelCache` silent iOS no-op | instrument-and-revisit | throw or gate at call site on iOS |

### Verification pass - 2026-07-06 (before acting)

Every "delete-safe" candidate was re-grepped across `src`, `__tests__`, and `pro/`
before touching anything. The recon **over-reported**: most flagged symbols are
actually referenced (largely by tests, some by prod). Blind deletion would have
broken the suite. Verified outcomes:

- **RESOLVED (removed):**
  - IM1 - duplicate `ImageGenerationState` in `types/index.ts`: zero importers (every
    consumer takes the service's version). Deleted.
  - AU3 - `whisperService.downloadFromUrl` + the `whisperStore.downloadFromUrl` action:
    no UI/hook/screen/pro caller (custom-URL whisper download was never wired). Removed
    across service + store + its orphaned tests.
- **FALSE POSITIVE - verified USED, kept:**
  - AU1 `whisperStore.deleteModel` - called at whisperStore.ts:180/201 + store test.
  - AU2 `audioSessionManager.ensurePlayback` - full test suite + whisperService.test call.
  - DL4 `isMmProjFileName` export - imported by `modelManager/restore.ts` + tested directly.
  - ML1/ML2 - exercised by integration + memory unit tests (see corrected rows above).
- **DEFERRED (not "dead", changing risks behaviour - kept out of this PR):**
  - Unreachable-branch removals (DL1/DL2 `retrying`, IM3/IM7 iOS backend short-circuits):
    they never execute, but removing a value from a status/type union risks exhaustiveness
    breakage; do it as a typed refactor with its own tests.
  - Threaded-constant params (ML5 `cpuOnly`, IM2 `backend:'auto'`): passed to the native
    bridge; removing the arg changes the native call. Not dead in a way that's safe to cut here.
  - Race/stub items (AU4/AU5/AU6, DL5, DL3 deprecated-callback threading): need on-device
    observation before change - `instrument-and-revisit`, not a blind edit.

Net: the genuinely-dead, safe-to-remove set was small (IM1 + AU3). Removed here; the
rest stay in the register with an honest verdict rather than a risky change.

### Handling policy (how we close these)
1. **delete-safe** → each removed in a small, single-concern PR with a grep proof of zero references in the description.
2. **fix-the-guard** → fix the condition, add a fails-before/passes-after test that exercises the now-reachable branch.
3. **instrument-and-revisit** → add a `[*-SM]` trace + a Provit journey; only decide delete-vs-keep after observing it live.
4. **Standing gate** → add `knip` (or `ts-prune`) to CI to catch category-1 (unreferenced) dead code continuously, so this register only ever needs the reasoning-heavy categories.

## Image-gen QNN over-recommendation on non-flagship Snapdragons - 2026-07-08

**Verdict: fix-the-guard (DEFERRED - needs a curated SoC allowlist + on-device rounds, intentionally out of the current release).**

**Symptom (observed live on an AC2001 / OnePlus Nord, SoC SM7250):** the app recommends
a QNN/NPU image model, the user downloads + loads it, and the native local-dream process
crashes: `Failed to load image model: Server process exited with code 1. Your device
(SM7250) may not support this model's backend. Try a CPU model instead.` So it recommends
NPU and then reports NPU unsupported - a self-contradiction.

**Root cause (`src/services/hardware.ts`):**
- `classifySmNumber` buckets every non-flagship Snapdragon into `'min'` (the catch-all,
  the `return 'min'` after the 8gen1/8gen2 sets).
- `hasNPU = vendor === 'qualcomm' && !!qnnVariant` → `'min'` counts as NPU-capable → `true`.
- `getQualcommImageRec` returns `recommendedBackend: 'qnn'` for ALL variants (incl. `'min'`),
  with `compatibleBackends: ['qnn','mnn']`.
- So a SoC like SM7250 (Hexagon that can't actually run the QNN image binaries) is told QNN
  works, passes the pre-load gate (`checkImageModelCanLoad` only blocks qnn when `!hasNPU`),
  and crashes at runtime.

**Fix direction (do properly, not rushed):** QNN capability must be a narrow, verified set
(8gen1/8gen2, or an explicit allowlist), not "any Snapdragon". Then `hasNPU`/recommendation
key off ACTUAL QNN-capability; the catch-all recommends `mnn` (reliable GPU/CPU). That fixes
both the bad recommendation and the runtime crash (the pre-load gate would also block a
manually-selected qnn model with a clear message instead of a hard crash). Needs device
verification on affected SoCs (SM7250 and at least one true 8gen1/8gen2) before shipping -
hence deferred, not patched blind.

## Image-gen inline preview not shown on first run - 2026-07-08

**Verdict: instrument-and-revisit (native-emission behaviour, not a JS/UI bug).**

Observed on-device (OnePlus Nord, mnn/OpenCL, first run): the "Generating Image" card
showed no inline preview thumbnail. The UI IS wired correctly — `ChatScreenComponents`
renders `imagePreviewPath` when set, fed by imageGenerationService's onPreview →
appStore. The preview only appears when the NATIVE localdream module includes
`previewPath` in its progress events (`localDreamGenerator.ts:123`, optional field). No
preview events were emitted for this run — consistent with first-run OpenCL kernel
compilation skipping the (expensive) intermediate-latent decode while warming.

Next: confirm whether previews appear on a SECOND (warmed) generation. If they do, this
is expected first-run behaviour (optionally: show a "preview available after first run"
hint). If they never appear on mnn, it's a native gap in the localdream preview path to
fix on the native side — the JS/UI layer is already correct, so no JS change is warranted.

## On-device test session - 2026-07-09 (Qwythos-9B vision + memory, 12GB iPhone/Android)

Surfaced live on real hardware during 0.0.103 vision/memory testing. None caught by the
green suite — the reason the on-device gate is mandatory. Verdicts + evidence below.

| # | Finding | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---------|---------|----------|
| OD1 | **Vision (mmproj) dropped on download retry** | fix-the-guard | `[DL-SM]` iPhone: main GGUF failed at 9% ("network connection lost") → auto-retry re-issued `needsMmProj:false, mmProjLocalPath:null` → finalized text-only (`savedEngine:llama`, `mmProjFileExists:false`). release/0.0.103 fix (persist metadataJson) targets this; UNVERIFIED on-device. |
| OD2 | **Repair Vision has no progress feedback** | fix-the-guard | ~900MB mmproj re-download behind an indeterminate "Repairing…" spinner; `[linkOrphanMmProj] recovered` eventually fired ("Vision Repaired"). Needs determinate progress. USER-SELECTED to fix. |
| OD3 | **Chat vs Home model-selector inconsistency** | fix-the-guard | `checkMemoryForModel` is called ONLY in `useChatModelActions.ts` (:96, :311). Chat pre-checks (predictive fileSize×1.5 ≈ 8.4GB for the 9B → critical on 12GB → gates behind "Load Anyway"); Home skips the pre-check → loads via `makeRoomFor` (measured) → succeeds. Two surfaces, one decision, divergent logic. USER-SELECTED to fix. |
| OD4 | **UI freeze on forced heavy load (Load Anyway on 9B multimodal)** | instrument-and-revisit | Only iOS native edge-swipe worked; all RN touchables dead; debug log stopped emitting = JS thread blocked by the synchronous native load of ~6GB + vision projector. The failure the override survival-floor is meant to prevent; installed build predates the release/0.0.103 fix. |
| OD5 | **Android download retry doesn't resume after network drop** | instrument-and-revisit | `[DL-SM]` android: Qwythos errored at 75% ("Network connection lost"), retry dispatched (WorkManager resume in place) → NO further progress milestones. Partly a real WiFi drop; retry-not-resuming is the reliability gap. |
| OD6 | **Kokoro TTS asset stuck loop** | instrument-and-revisit | android log: `[KOKORO-DL] checkAssetStatus → downloading (phase=ready progress=1.00 genuineCompletion=false)` spamming — stuck "downloading" while phase=ready/progress=1.0. |
| OD7 | **Thinking toggle missing for Qwythos-9B in settings** | instrument-and-revisit | Model has reasoning (HF tags: reasoning) + emits `<think>`, but settings shows no thinking toggle. Capability detection gap for community GGUF. |
| OD8 | **Voice-mode thinking not streamed (appears suddenly)** | instrument-and-revisit | Thinking renders live in text chat but batches in voice mode. Suspected in the audio-layout display path (`pro/audio/ui/AudioModeLayout.tsx`), not just the TTS sentence-queue (`pro/audio/streamingSpeech.ts`). Needs the display seam confirmed before fix. USER-SELECTED to fix. |

## More on-device TTS findings - 2026-07-09 (later)

| # | Finding | Verdict | Status |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| OD-TTS1 | **Play does nothing / "not downloaded" though model is on disk** | fix-the-guard | FIXED (pro fix/tts-download-flag-reconcile). checkAssetStatus reported off the engine's volatile `_genuineCompletion`, which desyncs false on mid-session re-init/bridge-unmount (hydrate only runs on engine switch). `[TTS-SM] play() … downloaded=false` bailing in ~1ms (no icon change). Fix: reconcile to the durable persisted `modelDownloaded` flag; extracted download actions to ttsDownloadActions.ts (no eslint-disable). Red-first test. UNVERIFIED on-device. |
| OD9 | **TTS speaks tool-call content aloud (voice mode)** | fix-the-guard | DELEGATED (fix/tts-strip-tool-calls). streamingSpeech `answerOf` strips thinking only; `enqueueReadySentences` runs stripControlTokens per-SENTENCE-fragment, so a `<tool_call>…</tool_call>` block spanning sentence boundaries leaks in fragments. Fix: withhold+strip whole control-token blocks before segmentation (mirror the thinking withhold). Red-first. |
| OD10 | **TTS stops mid-speak** | instrument-and-revisit | `[TTS Store] Engine error: KOKORO_SPEAK The model is currently generating` + `stream segment FAILED session=1 fails=2` — a double-speak concurrency collision aborts the stream mid-sentence. Needs the speak/stream serialization checked (a second speak fired while the first was still generating). |

| OD11 | **Voice mode can't stream TTS alongside a large LLM (falls back to end-of-turn speech)** | fix-the-guard | With a big model resident (Qwythos 9B, ~6GB), the single-model residency rule blocks the ~82MB Kokoro TTS sidecar from co-loading (`[Whisper] Skipping load — no room alongside the active model (single-model rule)`), even with 4.4GB free (os_procAvailMB=4405). streamingSpeech loops `stream feed SKIP: engine not warm` (442× in one turn) then falls back to onStreamingEnd speaking the whole message at generation end. Works, but no live streaming + long silence + log spam. Fix: allow SIDECAR types (tts/whisper/embedding) to co-reside with a generation model when real free RAM fits them (they're tiny), rather than subjecting them to single-model eviction. |

| OD12 | **9B loads slowly on CPU + feels frozen (GPU too small → CPU fallback, threads=1)** | instrument-and-revisit | CORRECTED (earlier entry wrongly said 'freeze / survival-floor hole'): the Qwythos 9B DID load and generate (log: `Model loaded, vision/tools/thinking: true` at 11:54:28, first token 11:55:20). GPU (Adreno 4.6GB) can't hold the 9.3GB model → `cannot be used with preferred buffer` → CPU fallback (all 32 layers). On CPU with **threads=1** (app default is nThreads:0/auto — investigate the 0→1 resolution) the load took ~1m43s with a janky/unresponsive 'Loading Qwythos…' UI = the 'frozen' feeling. Not a hard freeze, not a survival-floor hole (it genuinely fit). Fixes worth doing: (a) ensure threads resolves to a sane core count for large models, (b) keep the UI responsive during a long native load (load off the JS/UI-blocking path / progress), (c) OD13 below on the reasoning-format mismatch. |
| OD13 | **Qwythos output goes entirely to reasoning_content (thinking), answer content undefined** | instrument-and-revisit | Generation logs show `content: undefined, reasoning_content: "The"` and `token: "<|channel>"` (harmony/Gemma-style channel tokens) while `reasoning_format=deepseek`. The model's actual reasoning delimiters don't match the configured format, so the whole turn is classified as thinking with no final answer surfaced — the 'weird thinking/no proper answer' behavior. Model-format vs parser mismatch (Qwythos is a creative merge). Needs reasoning_format detection per model, or accept it's a bad-fit model.
## RESOLUTION note - 2026-07-09: OD4 / OD11 / OD12 root cause = threads=1

On-device follow-up: the iOS "touch-dead freeze" (OD4) and Android "slow/feels frozen" (OD12)
were the SAME root cause — the 9B ran with `threads=1` (device default nThreads:0/auto was not
resolving to a sane core count; device has 8 cores). Single-threaded native inference blocked
long enough to starve the iOS main/JS thread (touches dead; native swipe survived) and crawl on
Android. Raising the CPU thread count made BOTH fast and responsive — confirmed on device.
Not a regression from release/0.0.103; a config/default issue.

Follow-up (own PR, not this branch): investigate why nThreads resolved to 1 instead of auto/
core-count for large models (see `[LLM] Resolved params: threads=1`); ship a sane default.
GPU/NPU are NOT viable for this model (Adreno OpenCL max-alloc 1GB can't hold 9.3GB weights →
CPU fallback; Hexagon NPU experimental + needs QNN-converted models; Qwythos is SSM-hybrid).
CPU-with-proper-threads is the path. The devicectl "developer disk image could not be mounted"
is a Mac-side tooling wedge (iOS 26.5.1), independent of the app — reconnect to clear.

| OD14 | **Pre-tool-call reasoning not persisted (thinking "disappears" when a tool call starts)** | RESOLVED | In a tool-using turn the model reasons, then emits a tool call; that FIRST round's live thinking is cleared (clearStreamingMessage between rounds) and the intermediate tool-call assistant message is built with `content:'', ` NO reasoningContent (generationToolLoop.ts:447-448). The post-tool-result round's thinking IS shown on the final answer (confirmed on device: "Thought process: The knowledge base search returned no results…"). So thinking visibly vanishes at tool-call start then reappears on the final message — the pre-tool-call reasoning is lost from the transcript. Minor fidelity gap, feature works end-to-end. Fix: attach the accumulated reasoningBuffer to the intermediate tool-call assistant message. NOTE (good): iOS ran this 9B on Metal (99 layers GPU offloaded), 2.0 tok/s, TTFT 10.79s — iOS Metal works well; Android Adreno OpenCL (1GB max-alloc) falls back to CPU. |

## New bug reports - 2026-07-09 (Slack #bugs, during 0.0.103 review)

| # | Finding | Verdict | Note |
|---|---------|---------|------|
| OD15 | **"Generation Error: Unable to generate parser for this template / Jinja: Conversation roles must alternate" on model switch after a tool call** | fix-the-guard | From llama.rn native minja compiling a chat_template whose Jinja asserts strict user/assistant alternation, when tools are enabled (tool-call parser generation) and/or history has assistant+tool+assistant sequences. NOT caused by 0.0.103 (OD14 added a field to an existing message, no new message; OD3 didn't touch templates). Pre-existing. Fix: graceful fallback — catch the local tool-parser-generation failure and retry WITHOUT tools (the app already does this for REMOTE via isToolGrammarError; add the LOCAL equivalent), instead of a hard "Generation Error". Also consider sanitizing/merging roles before formatting for strict-alternation templates. Separate PR. |
| OD16 | **Remote model capabilities feel flaky across Ollama / LM Studio / OGA Desktop** | instrument-and-revisit | remoteModelCapabilities has 39 unit + 4 integration tests, per-provider — but all FIXTURE-based. Real-world flakiness is likely response-shape variance across provider versions the fixtures don't capture. Fix: capture real /props (OGA Desktop gateway), /api/show (Ollama), /v1/models (LM Studio) from LIVE instances as integration fixtures; harden derivation against missing/variant fields; add a provider-abstraction contract test so each provider's shape → derived caps is guarded. All three must work well (stated priority). Separate workstream. NOTE: 0.0.103's OD7 fix already made reasoning-detection single-source local+remote (small consistency win). |

## Repo-wide /hygiene audit - 2026-07-09 (SOLID §A/§B + DRY §C, all spot-verified)

Through-line: decision/capability logic derived ad-hoc at many call sites instead of owned once
by a service. Two findings (DR1, DR3) are root-cause siblings of today's shipped bugs.

### SOLID (§A/§B)
| # | Location | Verdict | Fix |
|---|----------|---------|-----|
| SO1 | src/screens/ModelsScreen/TextModelsTab.tsx:143 handleRetryDownload | BLOCKING | Renderer re-implements download retry (Platform.OS branch, store mutation, mmproj, polling) — CLAUDE.md L100 says this moved to ModelDownloadService. Delete; delegate to modelDownloadService.retry() like useDownloadManager:278. |
| SO2 | src/screens/ChatScreen/useChatGenerationActions.ts:460 | BLOCKING | Hook calls concrete liteRTService.invalidateConversation() off engine==='litert'. Move to activeModelService.invalidateActiveConversation(). |
| SO3 | useChatModelActions.ts:71,111,248 + useChatModelStateSync:368-390 | DEBT | supportsVision re-derived from engine==='litert' in 6 UI sites. Add activeModelService.getActiveCapabilities(){vision,audio,tools,thinking}. |
| SO4 | generationServiceHelpers:202,218 · generationToolLoop:386,747 · useChatGenerationActions:261 · useChatScreen:58,342 · modelReadiness:65 | DEBT | engine==='litert' + Platform.OS='ios' tool-routing scattered. Expose normalized capability/routing flags from service. |
| SO5 | src/screens/ModelsScreen/ImageFilterBar.tsx:55,73,91,129,139,149 | DEBT | Platform.OS chooses which filter DIMENSIONS exist. Data-driven filter descriptor from service. |
| SO6 | src/services/remoteServerManagerUtils.ts:122 | DEBT | provider instanceof OpenAICompatibleProvider to call updateCapabilities. Put on the provider interface (ISP). |
| SO7 | pro/audio/ttsStore.ts:377,385 | DEBT | instanceof OuteTTSEngine for cache ops. Optional getAudioCacheSizeMB?/clearAudioCache? on TTS engine interface. |
| SO8 | src/stores/remoteServerHelpers.ts:32,188 | DEBT-low | kind==='vision' capability branch; fold into shared deriveRemoteCapabilities. |

### DRY (§C)
| # | Location | Verdict | Fix |
|---|----------|---------|-----|
| DR1 | chatStore.extractChannelThinking + ChatMessage/utils.parseThinkingContent + providers/openAICompatibleStream.ThinkTagParser | DRIFTED (live) | 3 thinking parsers; the remote STREAM parser only knows <think>, omits channel formats → Gemma4/Qwen-channel model over remote endpoint leaks raw <\|channel>thought. Ties to OD16. One shared splitReasoning() in messageContent (already owns REASONING_TEMPLATE_MARKERS). |
| DR2 | remoteServerManagerUtils:60 (20 patterns) vs ModelsScreen/utils:41 + huggingface:178 (3) | DRIFTED (live) | Vision keyword lists diverged → Pixtral/Moondream/InternVL vision remotely, text-only locally. One VISION_NAME_PATTERNS + looksLikeVisionModel(). |
| DR3 | src/screens/HomeScreen/components/ModelPickerSheet.tsx:63,201 (*1.8/*1.5, -1.5) | DRIFTED (live) | Third memory-fit verdict bypassing memoryBudget.ts (self-declared single source). Can say "fits" when residency refuses — the Load-Anyway/selector bug family. Call modelMemoryBudgetMB. |

| DR5 | STOP_TOKENS (llmHelpers:427) + CONTROL_TOKEN_PATTERNS (messageContent:1) + tests re-hardcode | DEBT | One token registry; derive stop-list + strip-patterns; tests import. |
| DR6 | pro/audio outetts:363 + ttsService:207 '<\|im_end\|>' | DEBT-low | Shared IM_END_TOKEN. |
| DR7 | llmToolGeneration:32 (filter) vs generationToolLoop:118 (parser) Gemma tool delimiters | DRIFTED-minor | Parser accepts <tool_call: opener the filter doesn't suppress → tokens flash. Shared GEMMA_TOOLCALL_DELIMITERS. |
| DR8 | remoteModelCapabilities:202 deltaHasThinking vs openAICompatibleStream:155 | DEBT | Shared REASONING_DELTA_FIELDS + deltaHasReasoning(delta). |

### Test quality (§D) — 371 files, ~13 with a genuinely weak top-tier block
| # | File | Verdict | Fix |
|---|------|---------|-----|
| TQ1 | __tests__/**/useDownloads.test.ts | WORST | Fakes the reducer under test (hand-sets entry.status then asserts the spy) — 37 call-asserts, 0 real-state. Drive real useDownloadStore; assert getState().downloads[key].status. |
| TQ2 | ChatScreenSpotlight (step 3→12 block) | WORST | Block ends after advanceTimersByTime with ZERO expect() — can never fail. Assert the coachmark text. |
| TQ3 | Spotlight trio (Chat/Home/ModelSettings Spotlight, ~40 tests) | HIGH | Assert goTo(<int>) not the coachmark; unmock react-native-spotlight-tour, assert getByText(coachmark). |
| TQ4 | useChatGenerationActions.test.ts (132 called vs 16) | HIGH | L932 tautology + mock-on-mock "message appeared"; assert store/rendered outcome. |
| TQ5 | coreMLModelUtils "downloads sequentially" | MED | Asserts order that only holds by .map push order while impl uses Promise.all — false guarantee. Assert real ordering w/ dynamic out-of-order mock or drop the claim. |
| TQ6 | render tests w/ no getByText: TTSButton, ModelFailureCard, ImageGenAdviceCard, ToolAccordionStreaming, ModelsManagerSheet, McpAddServerSheet, PlaybackControls, KokoroTTSBridge | MED | Assert visible content/state, not just container testID. |

## Parse-once-at-boundary refactor - progress + remaining (2026-07-09)
Pattern: parse raw model output ONCE into a typed model; render from it, never re-parse (parse-don't-validate / anti-corruption layer). Kills the tool-call-leak class + DR1 + DR7.

DONE (committed on main):
- Step 1 KEYSTONE: parseModelOutput(content, reasoningContent?) → {reasoning, answer} in ChatMessage/utils.ts; answer clean-by-construction; contract test (parseModelOutput.contract.test.ts) asserts answer has NO markup for every format; buildMessageData delegates to it. 179 render/audio tests green together.

REMAINING (each a hub migration — grep callers, run ALL their tests in ONE invocation before commit; render tests assert BOTH what appears AND what must not):
- Step 2: point remaining direct parseThinkingContent/stripControlTokens RENDER callers at parseModelOutput.
- Step 3 (DR1, real remote bug + PREREQUISITE = MOVE parseModelOutput + parseThinkingContent DOWN to src/utils/messageContent.ts so store/service layers can import without backwards layering; re-export from ChatMessage/utils for back-compat). Then collapse chatStore.extractChannelThinking + providers/openAICompatibleStream.ThinkTagParser (only knows <think>, leaks channel formats remotely — OD16) onto the shared parser/grammar. Touches streaming + finalize — do as ONE careful wave in a fresh session.
- Step 4 (DR7): unify tool-call delimiters between stripControlTokens and generationToolLoop parseToolCallsFromText/parseGemmaNativeToolCalls (one GRAMMAR; parser accepts <tool_call: opener the stream filter doesn't suppress → flashes). 
- Step 5: delete dead duplicate parsers; full suite.
Note: Step 4 (store-time parse of the persisted Message shape) is the deepest cut — evaluate after 2-4; changes persistence.

### UPDATE 2026-07-09 — branch refactor/parse-once-boundary (Steps A-C + native-first)
DONE (committed on branch, all gates green — prettier/eslint/tsc/26 suites·834 tests/android bundle):
- Step A: moved parseThinkingContent + parseModelOutput + ParsedModelOutput DOWN to src/utils/messageContent.ts (util layer); ChatMessage/utils re-exports for back-compat.
- Step B (DR1): added REASONING_DELIMITERS (single grammar); deleted chatStore.extractChannelThinking+sliceThinkingBlock (route finalize through parseModelOutput); generalized ThinkTagParser (remote stream) from <think>-only to the shared grammar. Contract test (reasoningGrammar) + INTEGRATION test (reasoningPipeline: real store→finalize→render, local + remote flows, all formats, no-leak) green.
- Step C (DR7): added TOOL_CALL_OPENERS/CLOSERS (single grammar); stripControlTokens + ToolCallTokenFilter both derive from it (fixes the <tool_call: colon leak the parser accepted but stripper/filter missed). Contract test (toolCallGrammar) across full opener×closer matrix + char-by-char.
- Native-first: buildThinkingCompletionParams Gemma4 reasoning_format 'none'→'auto' so llama.cpp parses Gemma channel + tool calls NATIVELY (resolveToolCalls/finalize already fall back to hand-parse only when native is empty, so behavior-neutral if 'auto' doesn't recognise it). Added [ToolLoop][GEMMA-FALLBACK] log when the hand-parser fires.

REMAINING — Step 5 = ON-DEVICE PROOF (GATE before any beta/release, §H):
- The native-first flip is a RUNTIME behavior change, NOT verified on-device. Run a Gemma4 thinking + tool-call flow on Android dev build (ai.offgridmobile.dev) AND iOS; pull Documents/offgrid-debug.log; grep [GEMMA-FALLBACK].
  - If it NEVER fires → native 'auto' works → DELETE parseGemmaNativeToolCalls + Gemma <|channel> branches (dead) + narrow the hand-parsers to the remote-only fallback.
  - If it fires → native 'auto' does NOT cover Gemma in this llama.rn build → keep the hand-parser; the grammar work stands as the fallback. (Relates to OD13: reasoning_format vs actual channel-format mismatch — 'auto' may also fix OD13.)
- Must not ship the native-first flip in a beta until this device check passes (TestFlight is distribution-signed → no container logs; verify on the dev build first).

## Pre-existing: mid-chat model switch doesn't refresh chat state until remount - 2026-07-10
**instrument-and-revisit** | Reported on-device (iOS, gemma-4 local + remote), confirmed present on the OLD build (NOT introduced by the parse-once/selection/whisper work). Loading a new model from within the Chat screen mid-conversation does not update the screen's derived active-model state — it's not a freeze/hang; navigating Home → back into the chat re-syncs and it works. Suspect useChatModelStateSync / the chat's derived activeModel not re-running after an in-chat load (the model loads fine; only the screen's projection is stale). Fix separately with its own on-device repro — do NOT bundle into the current release PR (scope + risk).

## Reverted: Android ZRAM-swap Load-Anyway credit caused an OOM - 2026-07-10
**resolved (reverted)** | Fix A (getOverrideAvailableMemoryGB crediting free ZRAM swap to the override survival floor) was WRONG for DIRTY models: GPU/LiteRT memory cannot be swapped, so a 5.2GB dirty Gemma-4-E4B loaded into ~4.5GB physical (swap-inclusive ceiling said "fits") and the device OOM-killed the app during generation (device log 19:03Z: `OVERRIDE - forcing load` with no REFUSE, then SIGKILL, no tombstone). Reverted both commits — restores the conservative physical survival floor (the shipped-safe behavior that was correctly refusing these). The original "LiteRT Load-Anyway refused on tight memory" is the SAFE behavior; making large LiteRT loads work needs real on-device memory profiling (physical-fit for dirty + killable-background accounting), verified on the dev build — not a swap-credit heuristic.
