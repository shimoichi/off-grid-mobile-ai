/**
 * Single source of truth for matching a multimodal projector (mmproj) to its model.
 *
 * There used to be THREE divergent notions of "does this projector belong to this model": a loose
 * substring matcher in modelManager (findMatchingMmProj), a strict stem matcher on the load path, and
 * huggingface's download-time quant matcher — plus isMMProjFile defined three times. The loose and strict
 * matchers disagreed, so the startup relink kept a projector the loader rejected (E2B model ↔ E4B
 * projector), which is the root of the vision-init failures (device 2026-07-14).
 *
 * The rule, per the product requirement: a projector belongs to a model when the model NAME + VARIANT
 * match. QUANTIZATION does NOT matter — one projector serves every quant of its model — so it is normalized
 * out. Strict by design: a near-name projector (E4B for an E2B model) is the wrong architecture and makes
 * initMultimodal fail, so a non-belonging projector is refused (never "closest"/"only one").
