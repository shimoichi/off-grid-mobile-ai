/**
 * Model residency policy (pure functions).
 *
 * Decides which on-device models stay in RAM. A phone can't hold every model
 * at once, so before loading a model we evict others to fit a RAM budget:
 *  - text and image generation models are mutually exclusive — loading one
 *    evicts the other (each plus its working set is too heavy to keep both);
 *  - speech (whisper) and TTS are small co-resident sidecars: they stay warm
 *    alongside whichever generation model is loaded and loading one never evicts
 *    anything; they're evicted only as a last resort when a heavy generation
 *    model can't otherwise fit (only text↔image are mutually exclusive);
 *  - pinned models (e.g. the ~100MB SMOL classifier) are never evicted;
 *  - when an incoming generation model doesn't fit, evict least-recently-used
 *    (non-sidecar, non-pinned) residents until it does.
 *
 * See docs/design/MODEL_ROUTING.md §4–5.2. Pure + deterministic so the policy
 * can be unit-tested without touching native model loading.
