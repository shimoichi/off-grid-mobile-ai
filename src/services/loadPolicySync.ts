/**
 * Load-policy projection — the SINGLE place the persisted "aggressive model
 * loading" setting is mapped to the residency manager's runtime LoadPolicy.
 *
 * Separation of concerns (MVVM-ish):
 *  - Views (the Settings screen AND the in-chat quick settings) only dispatch an
 *    intent: `updateSettings({ aggressiveModelLoading })`. They never touch the
 *    residency manager or compute a policy themselves — so the two surfaces can't
 *    drift.
 *  - This module PROJECTS that one setting onto the service that owns the runtime
 *    policy (modelResidencyManager). The boolean→policy mapping lives here, once.
 *  - The service (modelResidencyManager) owns the authoritative policy + memory
 *    math; imperative load decisions read it from the service, never from a
 *    reactive store snapshot.
