/**
 * Model download abstraction — the single uniform contract for downloading ANY
 * model type (text / image / stt / tts).
 *
 * Today each type downloads its own way (text+image-zip via the robust native
 * backgroundDownloadService; image multi-file via an in-process loop; STT via
 * downloadFileTo/RNFS; TTS via executorch's own fetcher) and the Download Manager
 * branches per type to list/cancel/delete them. That per-type wiring is why each
 * type breaks differently and downloads "get stuck for days".
 *
 * This is the seam: every domain exposes a `DownloadProvider`; the UI talks ONLY
 * to `ModelDownloadService`, which presents one list and one set of controls and
 * dispatches to the right provider by `modelType`. Adding a model type = register
 * a provider; the UI never changes.
 *
 * See docs/design/MODEL_DOWNLOAD_SERVICE.md.

  | 'queued'        // accepted, not yet transferring
  | 'downloading'   // bytes moving
  | 'paused'        // interrupted (e.g. waiting for network / app was killed) — resumable
  | 'completed'     // on disk + registered in its domain store
  | 'error';        // failed; retryable

/**
 * What a given download supports RIGHT NOW. This is how the abstraction handles
 * capability gaps gracefully instead of letting them become bugs (Liskov +
 * interface segregation): a backend that can't do something declares it here, the
 * UI renders controls from these flags (a non-cancellable download simply shows no
 * Cancel affordance — never a dead button), and the service refuses to dispatch an
 * op a download doesn't support. No caller ever branches on the concrete type.
 *
 * Examples of gaps modeled, not stubbed:
 *  - Kokoro (executorch fetcher) → `cancel: false` (no abort API).
 *  - Kokoro → `determinateProgress: false` (only a 0..1 fraction, no byte counts) →
 *    UI shows a percentage/spinner, not "X MB / Y MB".
 *  - the STT RNFS path → `resumable: false` (dies with the app) → a 'paused' such
 *    download surfaces as needing a manual retry, not a phantom "resuming".
