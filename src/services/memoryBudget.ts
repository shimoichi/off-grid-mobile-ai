/**
 * Memory budget — the SINGLE source of truth for "how much RAM this process may
 * safely commit to on-device models" on THIS device + platform.
 *
 * Both consumers read it so they can never disagree (one saying a model fits while
 * the other rejects it):
 *  - the residency manager (capacity planning + eviction), and
 *  - the pre-load memory check (checkMemoryForModel).
 *
 * The safe fraction is device + platform aware (NOT flat) because the fixed OS+app
 * baseline is a big slice of 4GB but a small slice of 12GB, and on iOS we hold
 * com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit which raises the per-process
 * cap well above the default:
 *  - ≤4GB: 0.50 (≈2GB on a 4GB device — safe in practice; the dynamic real-free-RAM
 *    guard tightens further under real pressure),
 *  - 6-8GB: 0.60,
 *  - 12GB+: 0.78 iOS / 0.70 Android (so a 12GB iPhone runs a 7GB model a flat 60%
 *    wrongly rejected).
 * This fraction is the absolute PHYSICAL ceiling; the residency manager's dynamic
 * budget (real free RAM right now) is the actual protection against loading into swap.
 *
 * Previously two places computed this independently (a 0.6 in the residency policy
 * AND a separate device-tiered fraction in the model-load check); unifying it here
 * is the fix.
 *
 * ── Load policy ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The SAME functions are parameterised by a `LoadPolicy` so "aggressive mode" is a
 * single data-driven knob, NOT an `if (aggressive)` scattered through the load path:
 *  - 'balanced' (default): the conservative behaviour above. Every existing caller
 *    that omits the policy gets exactly this, so the default is behaviour-neutral.
 *  - 'aggressive': commit a larger fraction of RAM and hold a smaller OS reserve,
 *    so big models (e.g. a 21GB MoE on a 24GB phone, a 3GB LiteRT model whose dirty
 *    footprint the balanced dynamic guard rejects on a 12GB phone) are allowed to
 *    load. The reserve floor is reduced but NEVER removed — that is the "lenient
 *    safeguard": we still keep the OS + app baseline alive rather than guaranteeing
 *    an instant jetsam.
 *
 * "Load Anyway" (the per-load override that forces past the fit gate) is a separate,
 * ALWAYS-available escape hatch — not gated by this policy. Aggressive mode changes
 * the default budget so fewer loads need forcing; the override remains the explicit,
 * per-load, user-confirmed way to push past whatever budget is in effect.
 */

/**
 * How the residency manager handles multiple models:
 *  - 'conservative': ONE model at a time — loading any model evicts every other
 *    (no co-residency), the safest on tight devices.
 *  - 'balanced' (default): co-reside models while the RAM budget holds; evict
 *    lowest-priority/LRU when a new model doesn't fit.
 *  - 'aggressive': balanced co-residency but commits a larger share of RAM (smaller
 *    OS reserve) so bigger models load before the gate refuses.
 * (A per-load "Load Anyway" override is separate and works in every mode.)
