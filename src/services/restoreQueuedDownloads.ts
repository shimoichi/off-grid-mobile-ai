/**
 * Restore QUEUED (not-yet-started) downloads after an app relaunch.
 *
 * Sibling to downloadHydration.ts, which rebuilds the store from NATIVE rows (downloads that ACTUALLY
 * started). A queued item never started — it was waiting for one of the 3 concurrency slots and lived
 * ONLY in memory (backgroundDownloadService.startQueue + a placeholder store row), so hydrate can't
 * bring it back and it silently vanishes. backgroundDownloadService persists its queue durably on every
 * mutation (queuedDownloadPersistence); this replays that projection on launch so the product rule holds:
 * a download the user asked for NEVER disappears — it survives the kill and auto-resumes.
 *
 * Re-issue goes through the SAME real per-type start path the UI uses (via ModelDownloadService →
 * owning provider.reissue), which re-creates the `pending` store row + completion watch. It does NOT
 * call backgroundDownloadService.startDownload directly (that would skip the store row + watch). As
 * slots are free on a fresh launch, re-issued items auto-start up to the cap; the rest re-queue and
 * re-persist. The persisted queue is CLEARED as items are re-issued so a second relaunch can't
 * double-issue.
