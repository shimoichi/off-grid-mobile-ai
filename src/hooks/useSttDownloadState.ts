/**
 * The SINGLE owner of "is this STT (Whisper) model downloading right now, and how far".
 *
 * Two surfaces render Whisper model rows — the Models screen's Transcription tab and the Home
 * "Speech" picker sheet — and they MUST agree. Previously each derived its own answer: the tab
 * read the canonical download tracker (downloadStore) with a whisper-store fallback, while the
 * picker read ONLY whisperStore.downloadProgressById. So a download tracked in the canonical store
 * (started elsewhere, or rehydrated after a relaunch) was invisible to the picker — it showed the
 * plain "download" icon with no progress while the tab showed the live bar (device 2026-07-15).
 *
 * This is that derivation, defined ONCE. The pure `deriveSttDownloadState` is zero-IO (unit-testable);
 * the hook wraps it over the two live stores. Both surfaces call the hook, so they can never disagree.
