/**
 * T103 (checklist Area 15) / M6 (DEVICE_TEST_LOG) — RED-FLOW, UI-behavioral.
 *
 * The aggressive memory policy (0.88 Android / 0.92 iOS) over-commits a single DIRTY model. On a 12GB
 * Android device with only ~3GB truly free, sending an image request with a 9GB dirty (CoreML/ONNX) image
 * model gets it ADMITTED — the model becomes resident — because Android's reclaimable-aware budget credits
 * the physical ceiling to a dirty load whose GPU/anonymous pages zram cannot back. The correct behavior is
 * to REFUSE it (a graceful "Not Enough Memory" card, nothing resident), exactly as balanced/iOS already do.
 *
 * Device ground truth (M6, docs/DEVICE_TEST_LOG.md:43): "aggressive (0.88 Android / 0.92 iOS) admits a 9GB
 * dirty model on 12GB at 3GB free; zram/dirty pages can't back it." The gate-verdict twin is
 * overrideFloor.redflow M6 (service level). This test proves the SAME bug at the UI altitude the checklist
 * asks for: the whole real stack — the real ModelLoadingModeSelector gesture → real loadPolicySync → real
 * activeModelService/imageGenerationService → real modelResidencyManager — over the RAM-sensor + native
 * leaves only, validated on the model selector's "In Memory" section (a sanctioned residency UI surface).
 *
 * PLATFORM: this reproduces on ANDROID (where the over-commit is live). On iOS the same 9GB dirty load is
 * already REFUSED by the survival floor (iOS does not credit the physical budget to dirty pages — no swap),
 * so the bug is Android-specific despite M6 nominally naming both; the faithful red pins Android.
 *
 * NUMBERS (deterministic): image model on-disk size 3,865,470,566 B → hardwareService.estimateImageModelRam
 * applies the Android 2.5× working-set multiplier → the residency spec sees exactly 9216MB = 9GB dirty.
 * RAM: 12GB total / 3GB free. Policy: aggressive (via the real toggle). These recreate the exact M6 cell.
 *
 * RED (HEAD): the aggressive gate ADMITS the 9GB dirty image model → after send, the In Memory section lists
 * resident-item-image (~9.0 GB) and NO "Not Enough Memory" card renders. On HEAD the load is not even
 * refused first, so no "Load Anyway" prompt appears — aggressive silently over-commits (see the split note).
 * GREEN (after the fix): aggressive must refuse a dirty model that can't be physically backed → the image
 * model is NOT resident (resident-item-image absent) and the graceful memory card renders instead.
 *
 * THE SPLIT — what the fake proves vs what the human confirms:
 *  - The FAKE (this test) proves the JS ADMISSION decision: aggressive lets the 9GB dirty image model become
 *    resident on 12GB@3GB-free (the wrong verdict the user's device then pays for). That is pure JS math in
 *    modelResidencyManager/memoryBudget, decided before any native load.
 *  - The HUMAN confirms the NATIVE OOM: on the physical Android device the admitted dirty load takes a
 *    low-memory-killer SIGKILL (zram/dirty pages can't back 9GB), because the actual jetsam is uncatchable
 *    and not reproducible in Node. The [MEM-SM] makeRoomFor log is the on-device ground truth for that step.
