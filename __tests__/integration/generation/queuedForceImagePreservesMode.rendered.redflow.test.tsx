/**
 * #510 4a919e3d — a FORCE-IMAGE send that QUEUES behind an in-flight generation must still
 * generate an IMAGE when the queue drains. On device the queued force-image message lost its
 * force flag: QueuedMessage carried no imageMode, so on drain dispatchGenerationFn re-decided the
 * modality at imageMode='auto' → resolveTurnKind classified the (non-draw) text as TEXT and the
 * message the user explicitly forced to image generated as a text reply.
 *
 * SPEC (the user's view): I turned image mode ON, then sent a message while a previous turn was
 * still generating. When it finally runs, it must draw an image — not answer as text — because I
 * forced image mode for that send. The force choice must survive the queue.
 *
 * Journey (all real gestures on the real mounted ChatScreen + real generationService/dispatch/
 * queue; fake ONLY the native LiteRT/llama + diffusion leaves):
 *   1. place + activate an image model, image mode still AUTO.
 *   2. send turn #1 (a normal non-draw prompt) whose native completion HOLDS in prefill
 *      (holdBeforeStream) → generation stays in-flight (isGenerating true).
 *   3. observe the STOP control on screen (anti-false-green: the in-flight state truly rendered,
 *      so the next send genuinely queues behind it).
 *   4. turn image mode ON (force badge) and send turn #2 with a NON-draw prompt → it QUEUES
 *      behind the in-flight turn #1 (the queued-message path under test).
 *   5. release turn #1 → the queue drains and dispatches turn #2.
 *
 * The prompt for turn #2 ("tell me about cats") matches NO image heuristic, so under auto mode the
 * classifier routes it to TEXT — the force flag is the ONLY reason it should draw. That makes the
 * discriminator clean:
 *   RED on HEAD: force lost on drain → dispatched at 'auto' → classified TEXT → a text reply
 *     renders, NO generated image.
 *   GREEN with the fix: imageMode carried through the queue → dispatched as force → the diffusion
 *     boundary runs → the generated-image bubble renders, NO text reply.
