/**
 * KokoroEngine unit tests — install-status detection.
 *
 * Regression coverage for the bug where a fully-downloaded Kokoro model
 * reverted to "downloading"/"not-downloaded" once its executorch bridge
 * unmounted (e.g. switching engines) or after an app restart, because status
 * was derived from the live engine phase + transient in-memory progress.
 *
 * The fix makes checkAssetStatus() consult executorch's on-disk cache
 * (BareResourceFetcher.listDownloadedFiles — ALL cached files, since
 * listDownloadedModels filters to .pte and can't see the voice assets) and
 * treat isFullyDownloaded() — phase==='ready' OR progress>=1 OR the COMPLETE
 * asset set present on disk — as 'downloaded'.
 *
 * Completeness is the full active-voice asset set (two core .pte + voice
 * embedding + tagger + lexicon), NOT just the two .pte: the .pte survive a prior
 * interrupted download, so checking only them reported "downloaded" the instant a
 * fresh download began — the Download Manager showed Kokoro completed (82MB) while
 * the Voice panel correctly showed it at 4%.
